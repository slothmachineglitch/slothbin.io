	<h3>Habeas data "Privacy vs the rise of Surveillance Tech" by Cyrus Farivar</h3>
	<p>	Cyrus Farvivar is a skilled writer, researcher, and writer. Favivar's book "Habeas data" explores and investigates through critical analysis of ground breaking court cases, the fine line between privacy, surveilance technology, and the law. Upon reading the book the reader becomes aware that in this age of hyper digital surveillance whats legal and what is illegal, particularly under the 4th amendment becomes blurry and unclear.</p>
	<br />

	<p>The book highlights a number of technologies law enforcement has acquired, either unbeknown to the public, or bought in secret through federal grant programs. Tech such as lisence plate scanners, which are now popping up everywhere, thermal imaging technology, and other covert tech such as IMSEI catchers or stringrays. It boggles the readers mind to contemplate what technology is available to law enforcement, and the huge potentional for abuse that this tech provides. Upon reading one thing becomes clear. There has to be legal regulations of these devices, and built in constraints for law enforcement.</p>
	 </p>
	 <br />
	 
	 <p>This book is a must read in this new surveillance driven world we now find ourselves in. Farivar put alot of work into this book and it shows.</p>
