	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a hobby musician with some experience playing in bands and recording audio.I have experience playing guitar,bass,drums, and ukulele. I also have an interest in manufacturing, English and sustainability.</p>	
	
		
		<p>I am an aspiring <span>web</span> developer enrolled in the web development program at CareerFoundry. I am new to the field of software development and hope to learn a lot on this journey. I hope to expand my knowledge of computers and how they work through the work within this course. Particularly the ins and outs of how web technology is used, implemented, and deployed. How does this specific technology work and why does it work ? I also have a fascination, and fear of <span>artificial intelligence</span>/machine learning after reading a number of books on the subject.</p>

	 <p> "Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the
	 intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of those
	 intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would
	 then be an "intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent
	 machine is the last invention  that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. "
